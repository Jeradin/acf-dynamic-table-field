== Description ==
Adds a Dynamic Table Field to Advanced Custom Fields.

This is an add-on for the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
WordPress plugin and will not provide any functionality to WordPress unless Advanced Custom Fields is installed
and activated.

The Dynamic Table field gives a few basic options:
Table Class - Custom Table Class for the Front End template.
Max Rows - Sets the maximum rows for the table in the admin section.
Disable Sort - this will disable drag and drop sorting of rows in the admin.
Fixed Columns - Set a fixed column count and  text for the headers.
Default Headers - If Fixed Columns is checked, you will need to enter default headers, one per line.

= I've activated the plugin, but nothing happens! =

Make sure you have [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) installed and
activated. This is not a standalone plugin for WordPress, it only adds additional functionality to Advanced Custom Fields.
